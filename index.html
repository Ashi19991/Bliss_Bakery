                        I have ordered from The Bliss Bakery for past 4 years, not been disappointed. Baked goods
                        delivered to your house.
                        Independent business, started in Birmingham, food cooked from the heart, the best croissants ü•ê
                        I have ever tasted.
                        Macrons, cookies, freshly made bread, vegan options too. What is not to like?

                        We came here after reading some great reviews.
                        We ordered caramel and chocolate profiterole, lemon meringue croissant, carrot cake and cinnamon
                        bun, focaccia bread and
                        2 double espresso.

                        The cakes are awesome. Very light and so tasty.
                        Very nice coffee, not too bitter and the focaccia was just lovely.

                        Had a bit of a wait as it was very busy and only had one staff member but it was definitely
                        worth it.

                        Great range of home baked goods, including breads, pasties, sausage rolls, croissants, and more,
                        using locally produced
                        ingredients. Sit outside on the comfy benches or take your purchase home. Highly recommend the

                        Doing an early shift at work and no time to grab breakfast so I popped out to this hidden gem
                        just minutes away from
                        work not knowing what to expect and was really glad I went.

                        The displays make it impossible to choose just one thing so I had a croque monsieur for
                        breakfast and a chocolate and
                        caramel profiterole for later. Both were utterly delicious, so much so that I went back the
                        following day for breakfast
                        again!

                        It's not the cheapest place, but the prices are worth every penny as the food is of a really
                        high quality. Most
                        definitely worth a visit, but be warned, you're going to get addicted!

                        I recently discovered The Bliss Bakery and it's a hidden gem! This place is an outdoor paradise
                        with a cute little hut
                        where you place your order. It's such a cool setup!

                        The breakfast at Bliss Bakery is fantastic. They have a great selection of tasty treats that
                        will satisfy any craving.

                        The atmosphere is super cozy, and the staff is friendly and welcoming. It's the perfect spot to
                        start your day with a
                        delicious breakfast in a unique setting.

                        Trust me, if you're looking for a great breakfast place, Bliss Bakery is the way to go. It's a
                        hidden gem that deserves
                        all the love!
